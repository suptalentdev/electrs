Snapshot DB after successful indexing - and run queries on this snapshot
Handle bitcoind connection failures - instead of crashing
Use p2p protocol for querying blocks - similar to `bitcoincore-indexd`
Don't require -txindex by using `getrawtransaction "txid" verbose "blockhash"` RPC
Measure first-time query latency
Support "blockchain.estimatefee" RPC
Use futures for electrum RPC serving and cancellation
Handle multiple RPC client in parallel
Lookup confirmed transactions only at their blocks (using `blockhash` parameter of `getrawtransaction` RPC)
